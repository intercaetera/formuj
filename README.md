> Formuj is still work in progress and not production-ready, but ideas, PRs and bugfixes are most welcome.

Formuj is a delightful React form framework and set of patterns built on top of [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik).

- Formuj is **simple**. The schema pattern is very easy to pick up and Formuj does not do much magic under the hood.
- Formuj is **flexible**. There are many ways to inject custom behaviour into the schemas for all of your applications.
- Formuj is **battle-tested**. The schema pattern has been successfully used in production enterprise applications.
- Formuj is **Formik**. At the end of the day, you still have access to the underlying Formik API for complicated functionality.
